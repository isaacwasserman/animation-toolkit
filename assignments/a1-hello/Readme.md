I decided to oscillate the y-component of the pupils as well.

## Look

I made the pupils stick to the cursor when hovering over the eye.

## Particles

This animation introduces collision and gravity to the particles. The animation can be reset by pressing `R`, and the gravity can be shifted to another direction by pressing `G`. Balls can also collide with each other if you uncomment line 27 of `unique.cpp`, but it's buggy so I left it out.
